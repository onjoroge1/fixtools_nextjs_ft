## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES STILL REMAINING

### 1. Best Practices Section (LINES 1325-1450) 🚨
**Current:** Talks about minification, formatting, performance optimization  
**Needs:** Complete rewrite for JSON → XML conversion best practices

**Current bad practices:**
- "Only Minify for Production"
- "Always Test After formatting"  
- "Automate JSON formatting in your build pipeline"
- "Combine with other performance optimizations"

**Should be:**
- Validate JSON before conversion
- Test against target XML schema
- Handle arrays consistently  
- Define root element strategy
- Document attribute vs element choices
- Test with target system

### 2. JSON Education Section (LINES ~1100-1300) 🚨
**Current:** Full W3Schools-style JSON tutorial with:
- "Learn JSON Formatting"
- Common JSON mistakes
- Valid JSON examples
- Interactive concept cards

**Needs:** Either REMOVE entirely or collapse into accordion

**Why:** This is about JSON education, not conversion. Hurts SEO focus.

### 3. Remaining FAQs (6 more to replace) ⚠️
**Current FAQs still about formatting:**
- "Can I format JSON automatically in my build process?"
- Others about JSON validation, syntax, etc.

**Should be conversion-specific:**
- How are JSON arrays converted to XML?  ✅ (done)
- Can I customize the root element?
- Does this support SOAP format?
- How are JSON nulls handled in XML?
- Can I convert XML back to JSON?
- Does it generate XML attributes or just elements?

### 4. Pro Tips Section (IF EXISTS) ⚠️
May contain formatting tips instead of conversion tips
